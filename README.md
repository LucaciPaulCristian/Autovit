# Autovit
I made a script for Autovit website that, based on a few search criteria stored in a SQL tabel, is searching for three different cars. The script is getting their unique specifications (such as mileage, engine size, location, etc.) found in every search result and inserts them into another SQL tabel to be easier to compare the cars and chooses the right ones.
